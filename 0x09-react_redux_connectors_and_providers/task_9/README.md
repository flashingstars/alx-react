29. Our components can become very verbose when we start adding connectors and actions. It is also becoming harder to tests what is supposed to be our React component, and the interations of the application. To simplify our architecture, we can use the concept of containers and components:

	- Create a new file NotificationsContainer.js. This component will take care of connecting to the state, and fetching the notifications on mount
	- The component should render the Notifications components and pass the required props to it
	- Modify the file Notifications.js. It should now become a functional component
	- Create a new test file for NotificationsContainer.js. It should make sure the fetching is happening on mount
	- Modify Notifications.test.js file to only support the new behavior of the file

Tips:

	- No need to repeat every single prop, you can use the spread operator
