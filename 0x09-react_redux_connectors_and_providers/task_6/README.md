22. To improve performance in your connector, you should always use selectors when you can. Letâ€™s modify the Notifications connector to reuse the selector we built in the previous project:

	- Update Notifications.js to use getUnreadNotifications
	- Map the markAsAread action creator to the component, and use it for markNotificationAsRead

Tips:

	- At this point, when you load the page, you should be able to see the list of notifications. Clicking on one notification should make it disappear from the list

Requirements:

	- Make sure to update the selector to use the same valueSeq you created previously
	- Make sure to update the tests to work as expected
	- Make sure to create the new actions that the action creators are using
