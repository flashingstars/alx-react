26. Our current selectors are useful but they are not really performant. Imagine a very long list of notifications with multiple filters on the type and on the read status. This would require a lot of resources to compute. Memoized selectors are very powerful in this sense.

Install Redux Reselect and create a new selector named getUnreadNotificationsByType in notificationSelector.js:

	- This selector should combine the state of the filter, and the list of notifications
	- When the filter is set to default, it should return all the unread notifications
	- When the filter is set to urgent, it should return all the unread and urgent notifications
	- Delete getUnreadNotifications

27. In the Notifications component:

	- Update the component to use the new selector you just created
	- Map the component to the Action setNotificationFilter
	- Add two buttons under the text Here is the list of notifications. The first one contains ‚ÄºÔ∏è. On click, it set the filters of notifications to URGENT. The second one contains üí†. On click, it sets the filter of notifications to DEFAULT

28. In Notifications.test.js, add two new tests:

	- Clicking on the first button should call setNotificationFilter with URGENT
	- Clicking on the second button should call setNotificationFilter with DEFAULT

In notificationSelector.test.js:

	- Update the previous tests to work correctly
	- Create a new test to verify that the selector returns unread urgent notifications when the filter is set

Tips:

	- At this point, you should be able to load the notifications panel, filter the list using the two new buttons, and mark items as read

Requirements:

	- Make sure to update the tests to work as expected
